### This is for everyone to get familiar with this system and for us to hae one to break and have fun with

Version changes are scary


GitHub is an online platform primarily used for storing, managing, and sharing code, and facilitating collaboration on software development projects. It works by using Git, a distributed version control system, which allows developers to track changes to their code, revert to previous versions, and work on different versions of a project simultaneously. 

## Key Features and Functionality:

### Repository Hosting:
GitHub allows developers to create repositories, which are essentially containers for their projects and code. 

### Version Control:
Git, which GitHub leverages, keeps track of changes made to the code, allowing for easy rollback to earlier versions or branching off to experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase. 

### Collaboration:
GitHub facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, share code, and review each other's changes through pull requests. 

### Issue Tracking:
GitHub provides a system for developers to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to a project.
